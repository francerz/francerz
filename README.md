ğŸ–– Greetings and thank you to come.

Here you'll find some interesting code experiments ğŸ§ª.

A lot of libraries ğŸ“š created for my work and also as a hobby.

- SQL Builder for PHP: A Query Builder with some advanced features for safe, fast, reliable and simple relational data base handling.
- Mexican ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½ utilities: mx-curp, mx-rfc and mx-clabe.
- OAuth 2.1 ğŸ”‘ PHP Libraries: oauth2-client, oauth2-authorization-server and oauth2-resource-server.
